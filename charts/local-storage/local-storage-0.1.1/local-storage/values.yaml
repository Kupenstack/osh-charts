  # For each mount path, one PV should be created.
  # If there are two mount paths for local storage are available on two nodes,
  # then two PVs details should be defined. Example:
  # - name: local-pv-1 (name of the Persistent Volume 1)
  #   reclaimpolicy: Retain (Reclaim Policy for the PV local-pv-1)
  #   storage_capacity: "100Gi" (Storage capacity of the PV local-pv-1)
  #   access_modes: [ "ReadWriteOnce" ] (Access mode for the PV local-pv-1)
  #   local_path: /mnt/disk/vol1 (Mount path of the local disk, local-pv-1 will be created on)
  # - name: local-pv-2 (name of the Persistent Volume 2)
  #   reclaimpolicy: Retain (Reclaim Policy for the PV local-pv-2)
  #   storage_capacity: "100Gi" (Storage capacity of the PV local-pv-2)
  #   access_modes: [ "ReadWriteOnce" ] (Access mode for the PV local-pv-2)
  #   local_path: /mnt/disk/vol2 (Mount path of the local disk, local-pv-2 will be created on)
  # Similarly if three nodes each have disk mount path /var/lib/kubernetes
  # which will be acting as local storage for each node, then Persistentvolumes
  # should be updated with three entries.
